  <p>
    We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While we
    retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable
    means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure,
    copying, use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of
    electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and cannot guarantee
    absolute data security. If necessary, we may retain your personal
    information for our compliance with a legal obligation or in order to
    protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural
