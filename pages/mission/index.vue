          <p>
            After a survey attempt, we redirect the respondent back to our panel and communicate the outcome to him regardless of whether it is a screen-out or a complete. Many panels use a router to keep a user in an endless loop until they can get a complete out of him. We do not employ a router as it encourages participants to give insincere responses to escape the router.

          <p>
            Each time a respondent enters a survey experience, we ask them for feedback on their experience. This includes drop-outs which are hard to gather feedback on for most panels. In the interest of our clients, we sustain an inventory of surveys providing a fair and pleasant user experience. We rigorously remove surveys from our panel that do not satisfy our requirements for user satisfaction.

          <p>
            We accurately match panelists with surveys based on their profiles and the surveysâ€™ qualifications and quotas. We do not send users into surveys they will most likely get screened-out from. Properly matched respondents have shown to be more focused and honest, hence producing a more accurate sample. We always deliver a representative unbiased sample based on our clients' requirements.

            Keeping qualifications and quotas continuously up-to-date ensures that each panelist has a fair chance to complete the survey he enters.
